# Snake-water-and-gun-game
The Snake, Water, and Gun game is a variation of the popular Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The rules and gameplay are similar, but with different symbols: Snake, Water, and Gun

Your code snippet is for a Python implementation of the Snake, Water, and Gun game, where the player inputs their choice, and the computer's choice is fixed to "Water" (represented by -1). Here's a breakdown of your code and a sample README.md for this project:
